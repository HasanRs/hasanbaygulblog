Imagine a place where nightlife never ends. It's such a place that the fun never ends. They even receive plenty of visitors from neighboring planets. Some locals are kind, tolerant, and know how to have fun. Of course, if we think so.

An orphan planet without a star. It floats alone in the huge universe. That's where PSO J318.5−22. I came across this planet while searching for a story for my game. Discovered in October 2013 using direct imaging, PSO J318.5-22 belongs to a special class of planets called rogue, or free-floating, planets. Wandering alone in the galaxy, they do not orbit a parent star. Not much is known about how these planets come to exist, but scientists theorize that they may be either failed stars or planets ejected from very young systems after an encounter with another planet. These rogue planets glow faintly from the heat of their formation. Once they cool down, they will be dancing in the dark.

I end my speech with a famous quote from Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.
